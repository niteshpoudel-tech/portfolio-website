                <p>Hi! I'm Nitesh Poudel, a dedicated student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Information Technology (BIT). My passion lies in exploring the dynamic world of technology and learning how to build innovative solutions to real-world problems.</p>
                
                <p>As a BIT student, I have developed a strong foundation in various programming languages and technologies. I'm particularly interested in web development, data analysis, and software engineering. My academic journey has equipped me with the skills to tackle complex challenges and think critically about the tech-driven world.</p>
                
                <p>In addition to my studies, I've worked on several projects that have allowed me to apply my skills in practical settings. I enjoy collaborating with peers to create functional and efficient software solutions.</p>
                
                <p>When I'm not immersed in code, I enjoy exploring new technologies, playing video games, and staying updated with the latest trends in the tech industry. I believe in continuous learning and am always eager to expand my knowledge and skills.</p>
